	abstract = {Downs's (1957) theory of voting maintains that individuals balance the costs of voting against anticipated benefits in deciding whether to vote. However, most empirical tests of his theory have concluded that costs play little role in individuals' decisions to vote or abstain, and that benefits are the determining factor. Unfortunately, the existing empirical tests of the theory have been inadequate, especially in regard to the measurement of the cost of voting. Using data from the Comparative State Elections Project, we develop an improved indicator of the cost of voting. When this measure of cost is used in a test of Downs's theory, we find, contrary to most earlier research, that the cost of voting seems to be a more important determinant of participation than the factors associated with voting benefits in Downs's model.},

	url = {https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/IJF7Campbell.pdf},
	abstract = {This article examines four problems with past evaluations of presidential election forecasting and suggests one aspect of the models that could be improved. Past criticism has had problems with establishing an overall appraisal of the forecasting equations, in assessing the accuracy of both the forecasting models and their forecasts of individual election results, in identifying the theoretical foundations of forecasts, and in distinguishing between data-mining and learning in model revisions. I contend that overall assessments are innately arbitrary, that benchmarks can be established for reasonable evaluations of forecast accuracy, that blanket assessments of forecasts are unwarranted, that there are strong (but necessarily limited) theoretical foundations for the models, and that models should be revised in the light of experience, while remaining careful to avoid data-mining. The article also examines the question of whether current forecasting models grounded in retrospective voting theory should be revised to take into account the partial-referendum nature of non-incumbent, open-seat elections such as the 2008 election.},

	abstract = {This research examines an equation developed to forecast the two-party presidential vote in the states. The equation is composed of 16 independent variables measured at the national, regional, and state levels. It includes national trial-heat polls from early in the campaign, the growth in the national economy, presidential incumbency, the state's voting record in the previous two presidential elections, home state and regional advantages for the candidates, the partisan division of the state legislature following the last midterm election, an index of state ideology based on the roll call voting of its House delegation, and five regional trend variables to take into account partisan shifts over time. The equation is estimated over 531 state elections from 1948 to 1988. The overall fit of the equation is quite good. It accounts for nearly 85\% of the variance, leaves a standard error of less than four percentage points, and has an average error of just three percentage points of the vote. This level of accuracy is comparable to that of Steven Rosenstone's equation in his Forecasting Presidential Elections (1983). Moreover, the equation is quite parsimonious and yields forecasts by early September of the election year.},
